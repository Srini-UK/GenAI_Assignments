They have been largely inspired by styles of the late 1990s to mid-2000s, late 1970s to early 1980s, and the mid-century style of the 1950s and 1960s. The early and mid 2020s were driven by microtrends, social media influencers, and niche online communities that transformed internet aesthetics into the dominant tastemakers for music and fashion. Early in the decade, several publications noted the shortened trends, niche revivals and nostalgia cycles in 2020s fashion. Fashion was also shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on the fashion industry, and led to shifting retail and consumer trends.\\nIn the 2020s, many companies, including current fast fashion giants such as Shein and Temu, have been using social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram as a marketing tool. Marketing strategies involving third parties, particularly influencers and celebrities, have become prominent tactics. E-commerce platforms which promote small businesses, such as Depop and Etsy, grew by offering vintage, homemade, or resold clothing from individual sellers. Thrifting has also exploded in popularity due to it being centered around finding valuable pieces of clothing at a reasonable price.\\n\\nPage: 2010s in fashion\\nSummary: The fashions of the 2010s were defined by nostalgia, the mainstreaming of subcultural aesthetics, and the growing influence of digital platforms on fashion cycles. Overarching trends of the decade included hipster fashion, normcore and minimalist aesthetics, and unisex elements inspired by 1990s grunge. Throughout the decade, retro revivals persisted, including 1980s-style neon streetwear and tailored or fit-and-flare mid-century silhouettes that reflected a broader interest in vintage fashion.\\nIn the early years of the 2010s, youth-led trends, such as scene, swag, and East Asian streetwear trends, gained momentum through social media platforms such as Tumblr, helping to popularize bright color schemes, layered accessories, and skinny jeans. By the mid-2010s, athleisure emerged internationally as a dominant force, emphasizing comfort and functionality. Social media influencers became increasingly prominent in shaping fashion trends, particularly in the global spread of fast fashion through apps like Pinterest and Instagram.\\n\\nPage: Fast fashion\\nSummary: Fast fashion is the business model of replicating recent catwalk trends and high-fashion designs, mass-producing them at a low cost, and bringing them to retail quickly while demand is at its highest. The term fast fashion is also used generically to describe the products of this business model, particularly clothing and footwear. Retailers who employ the fast fashion strategy include Fashion Nova, Primark, H&M, Shein, and Zara, all of which have become large multinationals by driving high turnover of inexpensive seasonal and trendy clothing that appeals to fashion-conscious consumers.\\nFast fashion grew during the late 20th century as manufacturing of clothing became less expensive—the result of more efficient supply chains, new quick response manufacturing methods, and greater reliance on low-cost labor from the apparel manufacturing industries of South, Southeast, and East Asia, where women make up 85–90% of the garment workforce. Labor practices in fast fashion are often exploitative, and due to the gender concentration of the garment industry, women are more vulnerable.  Outsourcing production to low-wage countries perpetuates cycles of dependence and inequality, echoing historical colonial economic exploitation patterns.  The Design Piracy Prohibition Act was established to protect the designs of fashion designers. Numerous designers continue to sue fast fashion companies for copying their designs.\\nFast fashion's environmental impact has also been the subject of controversy.

The company sells clothing, accessories, footwear, and leather goods. Hugo Boss is one of the largest German clothing brands, with global sales of about €4.3 billion in 2024. Its stock is a component of the MDAX. The company's fashion brands are Boss and Hugo. Hugo Boss also sells licensed brand products for children's fashion, eyewear, watches, home textiles, riding apparel, writing utensils and fragrances.\\nThe company was founded in 1924 in Germany by Hugo Boss and originally produced general-purpose clothing. In the early 1930s, Hugo Boss began to produce and supply military uniforms for the government of Nazi Germany, resulting in a large boost in sales. After World War II and the founder's death in 1948, Hugo Boss started to turn its focus to men's suits. The company went public in 1988 and introduced a fragrance line that same year, adding men's and women's wear diffusion lines in 1997, a full women's collection in 2000, and children's clothing in 2006–2007. The company has since evolved into a major global fashion house. As of December 2024, it operated 1,532 own retail points of sale worldwide.\\n\\nPage: Dress code\\nSummary: A dress code is a set of rules, often written, with regard to what clothing groups of people must wear. Dress codes are created out of social perceptions and norms, and vary based on purpose, circumstances, and occasions. Different societies and cultures are likely to have different dress codes, Western dress codes being a prominent example.\\nDress codes are symbolic indications of different social ideas, including social class, cultural identity, attitude towards comfort, tradition, and political or religious affiliations. Dress code also allows individuals to read others' behavior as good, or bad by the way they express themselves with their choice of apparel.\",\n",
              " 'Luxury fashion trends for executives': \"Page: History of fashion design\\nSummary: The History of fashion design refers specifically to the development of the purpose and intention behind garments, shoes, accessories, and their design and construction. The modern industry, based around firms or fashion houses run by individual designers, started in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth. \\nBefore the mid-19th century, there was no overt division between haute couture and ready-to-wear clothing, but the most basic pieces of female clothing were made-to-measure by dressmakers and seamstresses dealing directly with the client. Tailors made some female clothing from woollen cloth. \\nMore is known about elite women's fashion than that of any other social group. Early studies of children's fashion typically pulled from sources of folklore, cultural studies, and anthropological field-based works. One trend across centuries was that Christian people typically dressed in their finest clothes, referred to as 'Sunday best', while attending church. Another is the importance of 'hand-me-downs,' receiving used clothing. In addition to hand-me-downs, sharing clothing among siblings has also been a trend throughout history. Prior to the nineteenth century, European and North American children's clothing patterns were often similar to adult's clothing, with children dressed as miniature adults. Textiles have also always been a major part of any fashion as textiles could express the wearer's wealth.\\nThe development of lithography allowed for the cheap production and dissemination of fashion plates, which in turn enabled fashion to spread throughout Europe and the wider world. Fashion plates were typically produced in Paris; regional dressmakers would then interpret and reproduce the clothing depicted. The origin of these designs lay in the clothing created by the most fashionable figures, typically those at court, along with their Dressmakers and tailors. Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and Abraham Bosse had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s, the pace of change picked up in the 1780s with increased publication of French engravings illustrating the latest Paris styles, followed by fashion magazines such as Cabinet des Modes. In Britain, The Lady's Magazine fulfilled a similar function.\\nIn the 20th century, fashion magazines and, with rotogravure, newspapers, began to include photographs and became even more influential. Throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought-after and had a profound effect on public taste. Talented illustrators – among them Paul Iribe, Georges Lepape, Erté, and George Barbier – drew attractive fashion plates for these publications, which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was La Gazette du Bon Ton which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925.\\n\\nPage: Hip-hop fashion\\nSummary: Hip-hop fashion (also known as rap fashion) refers to the various styles of dress that originated from Urban Black America and inner city youth in American cities like New York City, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Being a major part of hip-hop culture, it further developed in other cities across the United States, with each contributing different elements to the overall style that is now recognized worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Fashion merchandising\\nSummary: Fashion merchandising can be defined as the planning and promotion of sales by presenting a product to the right market at the proper time, by carrying out organized, skillful advertising, using attractive displays, etc. Merchandising, within fashion retail, refers specifically to the stock planning, management, and control process. Fashion Merchandising is a job that is done world- wide. This position requires well-developed quantitative skills, and natural ability to discover trends, meaning relationships and interrelationships among standard sales and stock figures. In the \"}"

            "    *   **Dress Codes Signal Organizational Culture:** A company's dress code (formal, business casual, casual) is a crucial signal for new hires about the workplace's values, professionalism, and accepted norms. New employees often want to \"fit in\" and may heavily rely on observed dress or explicit dress codes for guidance during the initial period.\n",
            "    *   **Impression Management:** New employees are actively trying to make a good impression. Their clothing choices are a significant part of this effort, especially when they are unsure of the norms. They may lean towards being slightly more formal than they perceive the average worker to be initially.\n",
            "    *   **Psychological Comfort:** Feeling \"appropriately\" dressed reduces anxiety and can contribute to better performance and confidence. Conversely, feeling under- or overdressed can increase stress.\n",

            "    *   **Clarity is Crucial:** Ambiguous dress codes (e.g., \"business casual\") can create confusion for new employees, leading to uncertainty and the potential for missteps. Clear guidelines, preferably with examples, are highly beneficial.\n",
            "    *   **Role Modeling:** The clothing choices of managers, senior colleagues, and, most importantly, the people they are *likely* to interact with daily, act as strong role models. Mentors, in particular, play a significant role in socializing new employees.\n",
            "    *   **Onboarding & Resources:** Effective onboarding programs frequently include information on the company's dress code or clothing suggestions for work. This is a crucial area of research when designing your own onboarding program.\n",

            "*   **Individual & Contextual Factors:**\n",
            "    *   **Generational Differences:** There might be generational preferences. For example, some may think that older generations may prefer more formal dress codes than younger employees.\n",
            "    *   **Industry & Role Variations:** Dress code expectations vary significantly depending on the industry (tech vs. finance) and the specific role (client-facing vs. back-office).\n",
            "    *   **Personal Preferences:** While aiming to align with company standards, individual comfort and style will always play a role. A \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to dress codes rarely works.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Where To Find Potentially Relevant Information (And Why These Searches):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **arXiv:**\n",
            "    *   Search terms: \"onboarding,\" \"organizational socialization,\" \"professional appearance,\" \"dress code psychology,\" \"workplace culture and dress.\"\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: You may find research that touches on these areas.\n",
